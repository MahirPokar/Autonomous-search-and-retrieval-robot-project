# Autonomous Search and Retrieval Robot Project 

## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository of the Manchester Robotics Team 6! We are a group of four robotics postgraduate students from the University of Manchester: Euan Baldwin, Mahir Pokar, Ao Xiao, Yilin Cao. 

This repository serves as our collaborative workspace for developing our robotic systems design project. Our primary objective is to create a robot capable of autonomously picking up objects from its environment.
