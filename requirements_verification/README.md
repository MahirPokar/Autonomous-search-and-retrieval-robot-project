# Requirements Verification for Leo Rover

## Overview

This folder contains verification evidence for the system requirements of the Leo Rover. Each piece of evidence is systematically labeled according to its corresponding Functional Requirement (FR) or Performance Requirement (PR) unique identifier. This structured approach ensures traceability between system requirements and their verification artifacts, supporting a rigorous validation process.

## Structure

The verification evidence is organized as follows:

- **FR X.Y** – Evidence corresponding to Functional Requirement X.Y  
- **PR X.Y** – Evidence corresponding to Performance Requirement X.Y  

Each file or folder contains documentation, test results, or analysis that substantiates compliance with the specified requirement.

## Usage

To locate evidence for a specific requirement:

1. Refer to the **Final Design Review** to identify the relevant requirement ID.
2. Navigate to the corresponding verification file in this directory.
3. Review the attached verification method (e.g., test reports, design reviews, simulations) to confirm compliance.

## Verification Methods

The evidence provided may include, but is not limited to:

- **Demonstration** – Proof of requirement fulfillment through operation.
- **Inspection** – Visual verification of components and assembly.
- **Analysis** – Theoretical calculations or software-based validation.
- **Testing** – Empirical results from physical or simulated experiments.
