If your computer uses an Intel or AMD based processor (which is the case for NUCs, most laptops and desktop computers), follow the commands below to download and run the installation script. 
  sudo apt install curl
  curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Interbotix/interbotix_ros_manipulators/main/interbotix_ros_xsarms/install/amd64/xsarm_amd64_install.sh' > xsarm_amd64_install.sh
  chmod +x xsarm_amd64_install.sh

udev Rules
Check that the udev rules were configured correctly and that they are triggered by the U2D2. This can be done by checking that the port name shows up as when the U2D2 is plugged into a USB port. The command and the expected output are below:
  ls /dev | grep 
  ttyDXL
